Abstract
--------

GnomeShell Reflection is an extension that gives you a classic style desktop.
It is mainly designed for the new Guadalinex distro (codename GECOS),
but feel free to use it anyway.

See http://www.guadalinex.org/

Installation
------------

 * Copy the extension directory under ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/
 * Restart the shell: ALT + F2, type "r" and press ENTER.
 * You are ready to go.

Because the message tray is moved to the top of the screen I changed some CSS
attributes, the message tray gradient and the rounded borders of the notifications.
If you want this changes copy gnome-shell.css to /usr/share/gnome-shell/theme
folder.
